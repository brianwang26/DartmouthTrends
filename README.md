# Dartmouth Trends
A new tool to understand grade distribution and enrollment patterns at Dartmouth College

## Objective 
During course selection time, many Dartmouth students go hunting for the medians of potential classes they are going to take. They hop from page to page on Layup List, D-Planner, or the Registrarâ€™s page, trying to determine if the courses they are thinking of taking will be layups or GPA sinkers. In addition to students, administration and academic departments should also care about these same data points that students search for. With grade inflation becoming more relevant, academic departments need a way to analyze the recent trends in grade distributions for their classes and overall department. In addition, to help inform departments on the capacity and frequency in which to offer courses, they need a way to determine the trends in enrollments of their department and classes. 

## What Dartmouth Trends Offers
Dartmouth Trends will offer an easy way to answer all the above inquiries. Dartmouth Trends will eventually be a website that allows Dartmouth students and administrators to compare the enrollment and grade distributions of classes over the course of a range of terms. Dartmouth Trends also allows for the understanding of more macro trends, as users will also be able to see enrollment and grade distribution patterns of entire academic departments on a year-by-year basis. 

## The Process of Making Dartmouth Trends

### The Data
Every term, Dartmouth posts enrollments/medians for every single course of that term onto a table on a page in the ORC website. Below is an example of the data posted for the 20W Dartmouth term.
