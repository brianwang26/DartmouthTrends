# Dartmouth Trends
A new tool to understand grade distribution and enrollment patterns at Dartmouth College

## Objective 
During course selection time, many Dartmouth students go hunting for the medians of potential classes they are going to take. They hop from page to page on Layup List, D-Planner, or the Registrarâ€™s page, trying to determine if the courses they are thinking of taking will be layups or GPA sinkers. In addition to students, administration and academic departments should also care about these same data points that students search for. With grade inflation becoming more relevant, academic departments need a way to analyze the recent trends in grade distributions for their classes and overall department. In addition, to help inform departments on the capacity and frequency in which to offer courses, they need a way to determine the trends in enrollments of their department and classes. 

## What Dartmouth Trends Offers
Dartmouth Trends will offer an easy way to answer all the above inquiries. Dartmouth Trends will eventually be a website that allows Dartmouth students and administrators to compare the enrollment and grade distributions of classes over the course of a range of terms. Dartmouth Trends also allows for the understanding of more macro trends, as users will also be able to see enrollment and grade distribution patterns of entire academic departments on a year-by-year basis. 

## The Process of Making Dartmouth Trends

### The Data
Every term, Dartmouth posts enrollments/medians for every single course of that term onto a table on a page in the ORC website. Below is an example of the data posted for the 20W Dartmouth term.

### Scraping the Data
Using Beautiful Soup, I scraped all the data for medians and enrollments for every single course that has been administered from 11S to 20W. To do so, I had a for-loop that visited each page where the medians/enrollments were posted for each term, and scraped all the data from those HTML tables into a Pandas data frame. Afterwards, I exported the data frame into a CSV file. Below is the head of my rawData CSV table.

### Processing the Data

**Splitting Courses** 

In the original data table, courses are given as Dept-CourseNumber-SectionNumber (ex. COSC-010-001). To better process the data, I first split these course tags into department name, course number, and section number.

**Assigning Quality Points**

On the original site, medians were given in terms of letter grades. I then assigned all medians according to their corresponding quality points (which divided by 3, yields the corresponding grade point value). To account for medians which had two grades (ex. A-/B+), I averaged the quality points of the two grades.

**Combining Multi-Sectional Courses**

Many courses have multiple sections. For instance, below you can see that in 12W, there were 19 different sections of Writing 5.

Because we are trying to understand trends for specific courses and specific terms, it makes sense to combine these multi-sectional courses. To do this, I averaged the quality points (medians) among all the sections and summed up the enrollment of all sections. Below is the format of the combined sections data table, as well as an example of the Writing 5 courses with combined sections.

### Writing Functions to Process User Queries 

Below is the function definition of the function I will use to process user queries. 

<img src = "screenshots/queryCode.png" width = "800"> 

This function takes in 5 main parameters. A list of courses we are interested in, a list of terms we are interested in, the name of our output file for our query result, and two booleans denoting whether or not we will plot the grades and enrollments of the courses we are interested in. Below is an example call of the function. 

<img src = "screenshots/queryCall.png" width = "800"> 

This call then results in a few things: it will find all instances of "COSC-10" and "WRIT-5" over the terms list we have specified. It will then write this result to "courseTrial.csv" which is shown below. 

<img src = "screenshots/tableResult.png" width = "600"> 

Furthermore, because we have specified that we want to plot grades and enrollments, this program will plot 4 graphs (one for each course for grades, one for each course for enrollments). Unfortunately, the matplotlib did not let me plot two lines on the same graph due to the mismatching terms COSC-10 and WRIT-5 are offered in. Below is an image of the grade distribution pattern of Writing 5. You can see that there's some significant grade inflation going on! Below is also an image of the enrollment pattern of Computer Science 10. It seems like more and more people are starting to learn those darn data structures.

I'm still working on queries that can process user requests on a department-by-department and year-by-year basis. 

## How To Use Dartmouth Trends (on your local machine)

Do you want to play around with Dartmouth Trends? Well you're in luck because I'm going to show you how. 

**STEP 1** 

Open your terminal and change the current working directory to the location where you want your cloned directory. Then type 
``` git clone https://github.com/brianwang26/DartmouthTrends.git ``` and hit enter. 

**STEP 2** 

Go to the Queries folder and open up "TestFile.py." 

**STEP 3**

You will now be using the function ```TermQueries.findCoursesTerms(courses, terms, outputFilename, plotGrades, plotEnrollments)``` to find out whatever you want. In ```courses``` you will want to insert a list of courses you are interested in in the form of DEPT-COURSENUMBER (ex. COSC-10). In ```terms``` you will want to insert a list of terms you are interested in. You can also use the options ```TermQueries.recentTerms``` for everything from 16F to 20W and ```TermQueries.allTerms``` for all terms from 11W to 20W. In ```outputFileName``` you will want to insert the name of the file you want your queries to write to. After this function is called, you can find this file in the same Queries folder you are in. Finally, `plotGrades` and `plotEnrollments` will be booleans that specify whether or not you want to plot the grades/enrollments of the courses you are interested in. And just like that you should be set. 

## Future Goals
For the next step of the project, I hope to be able to use React (for front-end) and Flask (for back-end) to a set-up a web-application that is able to functionally process user queries. I'm currently looking to have that booted up by mid-June, 2020.
