# Dartmouth Trends
A new tool to understand grade distribution and enrollment patterns at Dartmouth College

## Objective 
During course selection time, many Dartmouth students go hunting for the medians of potential classes they are going to take. They hop from page to page on Layup List, D-Planner, or the Registrarâ€™s page, trying to determine if the courses they are thinking of taking will be layups or GPA sinkers. In addition to students, administration and academic departments should also care about these same data points that students search for. With grade inflation becoming more relevant, academic departments need a way to analyze the recent trends in grade distributions for their classes and overall department. In addition, to help inform departments on the capacity and frequency in which to offer courses, they need a way to determine the trends in enrollments of their department and classes.
